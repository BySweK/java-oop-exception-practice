This project is a simple Java console application created to practice
core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and exception handling.

## Concepts Covered

- Encapsulation (private fields, getters and setters)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Checked Exceptions
- Runtime (Unchecked) Exceptions

## Project Structure

- **Account** (abstract class)
- **StudentAccount** and **AdminAccount** (inheritance)
- **Loginable** (interface)
- **BalanceException** (checked exception)
- **LoginException** (runtime exception)

## Example Features
